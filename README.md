# QoL_tools

Simple tools for boring tasks :)

## Tools Descriptions:

1. move_files_by_size -> Pretty self-explanatory... It only moves the files on a directory when it's size matches or is bigger/smaller than a value. Arguments are passed in argv for, in this order: src folder, dest folder and file size.
2. uniter -> Iterate over a directory full of .csv file and join the content into one file.
